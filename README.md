# Recipes Project

This project is a simple recipe website that allows users to browse and view various recipes. It is built using HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

The `odin-recipes` directory contains the main files for the project, including `index.html`. The `recipes` directory holds individual recipe pages such as `lasagna.html`, `recipe2.html`, `recipe3.html`, and so on.

## Getting Started

To view the recipes website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Project Assignment

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure

In the `odin-recipes` directory, you'll find the `index.html` file that serves as the main page. It contains the basic HTML boilerplate and an `<h1>` heading with the title "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

The `recipes` directory contains individual recipe pages. Each recipe is represented by an HTML file named after the recipe name, such as `lasagna.html`. These pages include an `<h1>` heading with the recipe name.

The `index.html` file has links to the recipe pages. Under the "Odin Recipes" heading, you can find a list of links to different recipe pages.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

Each recipe page has the following content:

- An image of the finished dish.
- A "Description" heading with a brief description of the recipe.
- An "Ingredients" heading followed by a list of ingredients needed for the recipe.
- A "Steps" heading followed by a list of the steps required to make the dish.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

Additional recipes can be added by creating new HTML files in the `recipes` directory with the same structure as the existing recipe pages. Don't forget to add links to the new recipes in the `index.html` file. Consider organizing the links in an unordered list for better readability.
